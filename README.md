# Eat_Da_Burger

This is a burger logger app set up with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

Functionality:
Users can input the burger of their choice, which will appear on the screen. They will then be able to click the "devour" button which will move the burger to the right "devoured" section.

Happy eating!
